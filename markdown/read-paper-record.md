1. 谈到了五支索马里越赤道气流
2. 影响越赤道气流的几个因素：beta效应、海陆热力差异、边界层斜压不稳定、非绝热加热
3. BOB与New Guinea的越赤道气流反相相关关系，这里注意怎么得到的：EOF方法、回归

> Zonal wind index (Jiang 2011) is used to characterize the interannual variation of the BoBSM onset in this study. Based on the 925 hPa zonal wind, the BoBSM onset date is defined as the first day after April 1 on which the average 925 hPa zonal wind over 80°–95°E, 2.5°–10°N (U) is more than 3.0 m s−1 in the following 7 days (including the onset day). The SCSSM onset date is defined by the first pentad that satisfies the following two criteria (Xie and Dai 2001): (a) the areal average zonal wind at 850 hPa over 105°–120°E and 5°–15°N (USCS) is more than 0 m s−1 in the onset pentad; (b) positive USCS must last for at least 2 pentads (including the onset pentad). Dates of summer monsoon onset over Kerala (MOK) are derived from Indian

1. 这篇文章认为青藏高原的热对流可以影响季风爆发，但我觉得是不对，是季风爆发把水汽输送上去才能影响青藏高原上对流
